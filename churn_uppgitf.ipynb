    "# Introduction!\n",
    "We are working with **a very obalance dataset**, and the task is to detect clients who **churn**. We have to choose a model that can predict  accurately those churns client to understand why they left the company, and to achieve that task i used the following models:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Logistic regression\n",
    "2) GradientBoostingClassifier\n",
    "3) RandomForest\n",
    "\n",
    "### **For the first 2 models** i applied the same methodology:\n",
    "After splitting the data into train e test, i trained the models and check the metrics. then i applied **a threshold** and check if the metrics got better. <br>Then, i used **SMOTE oversampling tecnique**, trained again those 2 model with the resempled data, and check the parameters  to see if the metrics could get even better. Finally i added a threshold even i the resempled data and check for the last time if the matrics got better.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **RandomForest** model instead, i didnt use thresholds or Smote, but i relied on an **inbuild parameter** called **class_weight='balanced'** that add **\"more weigth\"** to the minority class, so the model wont **\"ignore it\"**  \n",
    "\n",
    "I also encoded the data with labelEncoder and OneHotEncoder, and did some **feature selection**, deleting some features that wasn't relevant for the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is important to think in this case?\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to get more **TP** as we can, at the lowest **FP** price. **TP** are the class 1 churn clients, and represent the clients that left the company. (A little reminder: When **TP** increase, **FN** decrease accordly.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "# A litle knowledge about the matrics that we going to check to ensure that the model is good for our purpuse:\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **precision_score**: It measures in **%** how many of the predicted positive cases are actually correct compared to y_test(our real churn label 1). It answers: \"When the model predicts positive, how often is it right?\" High precision means lower false positives. \n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Recall_Score**:\n",
    "Recall evaluates how well the model captures all actual positive cases. It answers: \"Of all real positives, how many did the model find?\" High recall means low false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **F1 Score**\n",
    "The F1 Score is the **harmonic mean of precision_score and recall_score**. It balances both metrics, especially useful in imbalanced datasets where high precision or recall alone may be misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "# At the end of this page i ll show wich model i think is better for this task and why"
